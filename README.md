# LG-LapSVM
As a semi-supervised learning (SSL) method, the Laplacian Support Vector Machine (LapSVM) utilizes both labeled and unlabeled data to form a manifold regularization with graph theory and often receives a better performance than other SVM methods when the labeled data samples are insufficient. However, current LapSVMs usually struggle to handle high-dimensional data with transformation invariance such as images and videos, ignore the neighboring and distribution information of labeled data samples, and are sensitive to data samples around the decision boundary. Focusing on these problems, we propose a novel SVM method for SSL called LG-LapSVM by incorporating Lie group theory, the theory of local behavior similarity, and the RoBoSS loss function into the existing LapSVM framework. LG-LapSVM first represents data samples as transformation-invariant features on a Lie group manifold where a Laplacian graph is constructed according to geodesic distances between group elements, neighboring information, and class distributions of labeled data samples; then forms the Lie group manifold regulation by using the Laplacian matrix generated from the Laplacian graph and Lie group kernel metrics between each pair of data samples; finally trains an SVM classifier with an objective function including the RoBoSS loss function for labeled data samples and the Lie group manifold regulation. Comprehensive experiments on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of LG-LapSVM and the superiority of the method compared to nine typical SVM methods for SSL.
